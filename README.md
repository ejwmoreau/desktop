These are my updated dotfiles with a clean and safe deploy script. This will symbolically link config files for:

 - Terminal Coloring
 - Xresources
 - xmodmaprc
 - lightdm
 - bashrc
 - vim
 - vimrc

# TODO: Install any required packages for the files/scripts that get installed.
# Ex: dmenu2 from AUR, etc
