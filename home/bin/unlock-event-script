# Script to listen for events when light-locker unlocks the X session, so we can run autorandr

# If we try to do it by triggering a `display-setup-script` or `greeter-setup-script` in lightdm's config,
# then the X session hasn't actually been unlocked yet by light-locker.
# So we need to listen to unlock events via dbus to actually trigger it after the X session is unlocked
